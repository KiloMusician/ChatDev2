We are operating within the ΞNuSyQ multi-repository ecosystem consisting of NuSyQ-Hub (orchestration), SimulatedVerse (consciousness simulation), and NuSyQ Root (multi-agent environment). Create a Python integration module that can coordinate between ChatDev's multi-agent development team and our existing AI orchestration system. The module should implement the ΞNuSyQ protocol for semantic messaging, include consciousness bridge compatibility, and provide agent workflow coordination following our established directives for quantum problem resolution and self-healing systems.
