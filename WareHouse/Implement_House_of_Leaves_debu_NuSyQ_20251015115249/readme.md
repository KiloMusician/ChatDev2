# House of Leaves Debugging Labyrinth System
This project implements a debugging labyrinth system with 4 core modules:
1. `maze_navigator.py` - Parses error logs to create a navigable maze using A* pathfinding and provides XP rewards.
2. `minotaur_tracker.py` - Handles bug hunting with boss battles for complex issues.
3. `environment_scanner.py` - Scans the repository and provides complexity metrics.
4. `debugging_labyrinth.py` - Serves as the main orchestrator, generating quests from failed tests.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run each module individually or use the `debugging_labyrinth.py` to orchestrate the entire process.
